# Network-Intrusion-Detection-Systems-ML

Introduction: 

In the contemporary landscape of cybersecurity, the significance of real-time network 
intrusion detection cannot be overstated. Our project is designed to address this 
critical need by developing a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that 
utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to identify potential security threats 
within network traffic accurately. The RandomForestClassifier was selected as the 
backbone of our detection system due to its proven effectiveness in handling large and 
complex datasets with intricate feature interactions. This choice is pivotal, considering 
the evolving nature of cyber threats which require robust and adaptable detection 
mechanisms.

Methodology:

The project utilized the CICIDS2017 dataset, a comprehensive collection of labeled 
network flows that simulate a variety of intrusion and normal scenarios. This dataset's 
diversity makes it exceptionally suitable for training a model intended for real-time 
intrusion detection. We began by loading the data into a Python environment using 
Pandas, which allows for sophisticated data manipulation capabilities. A critical step 
was the encoding of categorical data in the 'Label' column into a numerical format, a 
process performed using Scikit-Learn's LabelEncoder. This is essential for preparing 
the dataset for machine learning algorithms which require numerical input.
Subsequently, the data was divided using a train-test split strategy, ensuring that 70% 
of the data was used for training the model, with the remaining 30% reserved for 
testing its performance. This split is crucial for validating the model's effectiveness on 
unseen data, thereby simulating real-world usage as closely as possible.

Results:

The performance of the RandomForestClassifier was evaluated using metrics like 
accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. The high scores across these metrics 
confirmed the model's capability in distinguishing between benign and malicious 
traffic effectively. A confusion matrix provided deeper insight into the model's 
predictive accuracy, illustrating the balance between true positives, true negatives, 
false positives, and false negatives.
An in-depth feature importance analysis was also conducted post-evaluation, which 
shed light on which data features were most influential in predicting network 
intrusions. This information is vital for refining data collection strategies and 
improving model accuracy in future iterations.

Conclusion:

This project has successfully demonstrated the potential of using advanced machine 
learning techniques, specifically the RandomForestClassifier, to develop a real-time 
NIDS capable of effectively distinguishing between benign and malicious network 
activities. The project not only achieved high performance in standard evaluation 
metrics but also highlighted the importance of continuous improvement and 
adaptation in cybersecurity efforts. As cyber threats evolve, so too must our 
approaches to detecting and mitigating them, necessitating ongoing research and 
development in this critical area of digital security.
